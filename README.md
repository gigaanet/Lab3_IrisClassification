# Lab3_LogisticRegression

Logistic Regression Project Overview
This repository contains a series of tasks designed to explore and implement various aspects of logistic regression in machine learning. The primary focus is on understanding how to perform logistic regression, evaluate model performance, and investigate the concepts of underfitting and overfitting. Additionally, we will implement multi-class logistic regression using the well-known Iris dataset.

Tasks Breakdown
Task 1: Logistic Regression Implementation
In this task, we will follow a step-by-step guide to perform logistic regression using Python. The implementation will include:

Data Preprocessing:

Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, sklearn).
Load the dataset (e.g., Iris dataset using pd.read_csv or sklearn.datasets.load_iris).
Prepare the data for modeling by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.
Training and Testing Split:

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Common split ratio: 70% training and 30% testing.
Model Training:

Utilize the LogisticRegression model from the sklearn library:
python
Copy code
from sklearn import linear_model
mymodel = linear_model.LogisticRegression(max_iter=120)
mymodel.fit(X_train, y_train)
Making Predictions:

Use the trained model to predict outcomes on the test set:
python
Copy code
y_pred = mymodel.predict(X_test)
Task 2: Model Performance Evaluation
After implementing the logistic regression model, we will evaluate its performance by analyzing various metrics:

Confusion Matrix:

Visualize true vs. predicted classifications using confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics.
ROC Curve:

Illustrate the diagnostic ability of our binary classifier by plotting the ROC curve.
AUC (Area Under the Curve):

Quantify the overall performance of the model in a single score using roc_auc_score.
Task 3: Multi-Class Logistic Regression on the Iris Dataset
Building on our previous work, this task will involve applying multi-class logistic regression techniques to classify the Iris dataset:

Dataset Overview:

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and three classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
Implementation:

Follow a video tutorial to implement multi-class logistic regression.
Download the code from a provided GitHub repository and execute it.
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Task 4: Understanding Underfitting and Overfitting
In this task, we will delve into the concepts of underfitting and overfitting in machine learning:

Bias-Variance Tradeoff:

Refer to a video tutorial explaining the bias-variance tradeoff and how it affects model performance.
Identifying Issues:

Explore how to identify underfitting and overfitting in our models through learning curves and validation techniques.
Mitigation Strategies:

Discuss strategies to mitigate these issues, such as adjusting model complexity, regularization techniques, and cross-validation.
